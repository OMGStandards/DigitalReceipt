TenderControlTransaction:
  description: |
    A type of Transaction that controls movement of tenders between repositories.
    TenderControlTransaction can record movement of tender from one tender
    repository to another as a single transaction. That would result in balance
    changes in two different tender repositories.  Another option is to record movement
    of tender from one repository to an accountable associate and then movement of tender
    from the associate to another tender repository.  In this case every transaction
    changes balance only in one tender repository and records the associate accountable
    for the money.
