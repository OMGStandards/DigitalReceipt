    Money transfer to/from an account within the Transaction.
    Accounts are often used to enable a business process
    across multiple transactions. For example, a payment can be
    performed in one transaction and captured in an account and
    later money from that account can be used to pay for the items
    in another transaction.  The concept of account is important
    to enable omni-channel capabilities.
