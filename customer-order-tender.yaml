CustomerOrderTender:
  description: |
    Tender information used to perform payments for the order.
    Customer order tenders do not represent payments or refunds
    against the order. They just capture tender data so that
    payments could be performed in the future.  They can also
    contain pre-authorization to guarantee that the tender can
    indeed be used to complete the order.
    Also the tender amounts could be specified to represent
    instructions from the customer on how much money should
    be charged using each tender.  Actual payment/refund amount
    will be captured inside Retail transactions where they are
    performed.
