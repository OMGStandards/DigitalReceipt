    NonTaxableFees - total non-taxable fees. Fees are typically added
      to total including tax to receive grand total for the transaction.
    TaxableFeesExcludingTax - total taxable fees excluding tax amount.
      Fees are typically added to total including tax to receive grand
      total for the transaction.  Since this total excudes taxes (see below),
      fee taxes have to be added as well to calculate grand total.
    FeesTax - total amount of fee taxes collected in this transaction.
      Fee taxes are added to taxable fees excluding tax to get actual amount
      to be included into grand total.
    Grand - grand total. The final amount after everything is added up.
    LineItemCount - total number of line items.
