Tip:
  description: |
    Money left by a customer as a gratuity to a service associate in 
    addition to the regular amount.
    Unlike a commission, tipping is typically irreversable.
    Tips are optional, descretionary payments.  They are not required
    and considered as non-compulsary, additional payments.
    Service fee or automatic gratuity, on the other hand, is compulsary.
    Unlike tips, automatic gratuity funds are considered employer funds
    and are not specifically designated as the property of service associates.
    However, it is common for an employer to share part of automatic gratuity
    with their employees.
