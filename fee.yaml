Fee:
  description: |
    Data about fee collected as part of the Transaction.
    There are two major types of fees. Sometimes a fee is defined as a price for
    a specific service.  In this case, fees behave similar to non-merchandise
    service items. Such fees can have discounts and they are often taxable.
    They can be considered as part of the net sales. On the other hand,
    fees can also behave as regulatory payments to a government authority,
    for example, bag fees or electronic waste recycling fees. This type of
    fee is similar to taxes. Such fees are not part of the net sales.
    Also, regulatory fees are typically not taxable.

    feeID:
      description: |
        A unique identifier of the Fee.
        Since fees can represent different business concepts, their
        identifiers, if exist, can also be semantically quite different.
        Some fees might not need identifier since feeType unambiguously
        describes what the fee is.
        If fee is similar to service item, then fee ID is conceptually
        similar to item or service ID.
        Shipment fee is associated with shipping method that identifies
        carrier and shipment service level, for example UPS Ground or FedEx
        Overnight. In this case, fee ID can be mapped to shipping method ID.
