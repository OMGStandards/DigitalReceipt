DocumentControlTransaction:
  description: |
    A type of Transaction that records activity with documents.
    It includes generating, printing, sending, etc. of different
    documents such as receipts, invoices, account statements, etc.
    This transaction type does not include document-related activities
    that happen as part of another type of transaction. For example,
    printing a receipt as part of a retail transaction is not a
    document control transaction but re-printing the receipt at some
    later point in time is.
